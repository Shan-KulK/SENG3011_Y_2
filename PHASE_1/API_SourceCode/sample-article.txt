        "The Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products (AEMPS) has reported over the last week several cases of thrombotic events in some European countries, including Spain, temporarily related to the administration of the vaccine against COVID -19 from AstraZeneca.",
        "The initial assessment of these reported cases of thrombotic events did not show a disproportion between the number of reported cases among vaccinated individuals and the number of naturally occurring cases in the general population.\u00a0The fact that the reported cases were not related to a single lot also indicated that there was no quality defect related to a specific lot.\u00a0In this context, the AEMPS reported, pending additional data and in line with what was reported by the EMA, that there were no reasons to justify the adoption of precautionary measures either on a specific batch or on the vaccine as a whole.",
        "However, throughout this past Saturday and Sunday (March 13 and 14), and today, some notifications have been received (one of them in Spain) of a specific type of thrombotic event that needs to be studied further. thoroughly as they are very rare in the general population1.\u00a0These are cases of cerebral venous thrombosis (specifically, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis), with the particularity of being associated with a decrease in the number of platelets in the blood, which would suggest an abnormal activation of the coagulation system that would result in this obstruction of the cerebral veins.",
        "The AEMPS and the rest of the drug agencies coordinated by the EMA, work to collect and analyze the information available on this signal as quickly as possible.\u00a0It is estimated that more than 17 million people have received the AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK and the European Union and the number of reported cases is very low in proportion to the number of people vaccinated.\u00a0In the EU, approximately six million doses of this vaccine have been administered and the AEMPS has learned of at least 11 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis reported in the EU, two of them reported today.",
        "However, this subgroup of cases should be studied to know if in addition to having a temporal relationship with the administration of the vaccine, there is a possible causal relationship.\u00a0The evaluation of this type of signs may end up finding an alternative cause to the administration of the vaccine or, if it is attributable to the vaccine, with measures that try to minimize the risk as much as possible, such as, for example, the identification of factors that predispose to the appearance of this type of thrombosis.",
        "Given that it has not been possible to find a link with a certain batch of the vaccine, and while investigating whether these events, which the AEMPS and the rest of the European agencies have heard about this weekend, are related or not to the vaccine, the Ministry of Health considers it prudent to suspend vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine against COVID-19 from tomorrow and for the next two weeks.",

The vaccine uses a safe adenovirus carrier that contains a cloned DNA strand, which causes nasopharyngeal cells to produce the virus protein which, in turn, produces a response to the vaccine. There is no actual SARS-CoV-2 virus in the vaccine. Preliminary results show that the vaccine has performed well in animal studies, and clinical testing in humans will start within a few months.",
        "Nasal delivery was chosen as the new vaccine\u2019s method of administration because the virus is also naturally transmitted through the airways. Indeed, nasal administration seems to induce a wider immune response than intramuscular administration.",
        "\u201cVaccines injected intramuscularly produce IgG antibodies in the bloodstream, but nasal vaccines also produce an IgA response that protects mucous membranes. We assume that this can also prevent those who have received the vaccine from transmitting the virus,\u201d Academy Professor Seppo Yl\u00e4-Herttuala from the University of Eastern Finland says.",

The vaccines currently in use provide a clearly lower protection against the South African variant, which will likely be the dominant virus in the next wave. Our vaccine already takes into account the most important variants, i.e. the South African, Brazilian and the UK one. There will certainly be a demand for this type of vaccine,\u201d says Professor of Virology Kalle Saksela from the University of Helsinki.",

        "\u201cOur survey shows that most Americans have or planned to act on the advice to get a flu vaccination this season,\u201d said Nowak. \u201cFurther, these results strongly suggest the U.S. will be crossing an important threshold this flu season, which is over half of U.S. adults getting a flu vaccination.\u201d",
        "The survey results indicate much of the increase in flu vaccine uptake is being driven by people 60 years old and older. A total of 61.5% said they had already received the influenza vaccine in December, with another 12% stating they \u201cwould definitely get it\u201d and 5.8% stating they \u201cwould probably get it.\u201d",
        "Demographic differences",
        "The survey results also indicated many demographic differences when it came to having received a flu vaccination. Forty-eight percent of white respondents reported having a flu vaccination by December, compared to 35.1% of Hispanic respondents and 30.1% of Black respondents. Having already received a flu vaccination was also much higher for respondents with a college or higher education and those with annual household incomes of $75,000 a year or more.",
        "Conversely, flu vaccination uptake and plans to get a flu vaccination were lowest for those 18-29 years old, those with some college or a high school education, and those with annual incomes less than $25,000. The survey found that 50.7% of those making more than $75,000 had already been vaccinated for the flu, while only 35% of those making less than $25,000 had been vaccinated.",
        "\u201cIt was disappointing to see that significant differences by race, age, education and income persisted during a flu vaccination season that took place during a COVID pandemic,\u201d Cacciatore said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we continue to learn more about why these disparities exist so we can take steps that will reduce them.\u201d",
        "\u201cOverall, it is good news to find that many people, particularly those at highest risk for serious flu or COVID-19 illness, followed the advice to get the flu vaccine. Hopefully, we can sustain that level of success in the years ahead,\u201d Nowak said. \u201cIt also remains worrisome to find much lower flu vaccination rates and intentions in so many groups. We continue to have much work to do among Hispanic and Black adults and those with lower income and years of formal education when it comes to flu vaccination.\u201d",

        "The Phase\u00a01B\u00a0clinical trial (LSV-002), ongoing at the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research in\u00a0Accra, Ghana, is the first vaccine clinical trial for Lassa fever to be conducted in\u00a0West Africa, where the infection is endemic. INO-4500 is also the first vaccine candidate for Lassa fever to enter human trials.",
        "INOVIO is advancing INO-4500 with full funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global partnership that leverages funding from public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organizations to support research projects to develop vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. INOVIO previously received a\u00a0$56 million\u00a0grant from CEPI in 2018, under which the company is developing vaccine candidates for Lassa fever and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). INOVIO and CEPI are committed to making a vaccine available as soon as possible for emergency use as a stockpile product post-Phase 2 testing.",
        "Dr. J.\u00a0Joseph Kim, President and CEO of INOVIO, said, \u201cWe have observed that INO-4500 vaccination generates robust antibody and T cell immune responses in a Phase 1 clinical trial conducted in the U.S., and this continued advancement of INO-4500 into Phase\u00a01B\u00a0trial is another important step in a \u00a0fight against Lassa fever. This trial also represents a significant advancement within INOVIO\u2019s infectious disease portfolio and further validates the company\u2019s DNA medicines platform and proprietary CELLECTRA\u00ae delivery device.\u201d",
        "Dr. Kim added, \u201cThis is the same device being used to deliver our DNA vaccine candidate, INO-4800, in the Phase 2 segment of our INNOVATE Phase 2/3 COVID-19 trial. We are grateful to CEPI for the continued support and confidence in our vaccine programs \u2013 and we look forward to advancing INO-4500 as a vaccine candidate against Lassa fever.\u201d",
        "Dr\u00a0Melanie Saville, Director of Vaccine R&D at CEPI, said, \u201cWe are delighted to see our partner INOVIO launch the first-ever Lassa vaccine trial on the African continent, with today\u2019s announcement marking an important milestone in the fight against this deadly hemorrhagic fever. With the emerging infectious disease remaining a serious public health threat across\u00a0West Africa, including\u00a0Ghana, it is crucial that populations can participate in vaccine trials to ensure sufficient data is generated so that they can be confidently rolled out in outbreak-prone areas in the future, dependent on safety and immunogenicity testing. Together, this work plays into broader research efforts led by CEPI to minimize the threat of the disease, including the launch of the largest-ever Lassa fever epidemiology research program launched in\u00a0West Africa\u00a0late last year.\u201d",

These awards represent NIAID\u2019s first series of grants focused exclusively on research on this therapy, an emerging field that could yield new ways to fight antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. A 2019 report from CDC found that antibiotic-resistant pathogens cause more than 2.8 million infections in the U.S. each year and more than 35,000 people die.",
        "Bacteriophages (or \u201cphages\u201d) are viruses that can kill or incapacitate specific kinds of bacteria while leaving other bacteria and human cells unharmed. By gathering naturally-occurring phages, or by modifying or engineering phages to display certain properties, researchers hope to create novel anti-bacterial therapeutics. Because phages eliminate bacteria by infecting them, rather by generating compounds like antibiotics which kill bacteria, phages can be used to treat antibiotic-resistant infections. In addition, some evidence suggests that combination therapy containing both phages and antibiotics could prevent bacteria from becoming drug resistant.",
        "Although scientists have been aware of phages and their ability to kill bacteria since 1917, the first U.S.-based clinical trials of phage therapy have only recently begun. Individual U.S. patients have received phage therapy, but only under emergency investigational new drug protocols. In eastern Europe, where the use of phage therapy is more prevalent, its efficacy has not been rigorously demonstrated.",

        "The trial launched at the end of March, when the disease was putting the world on pause and killing thousands.",
        "Hydroxychloroquine showed promise in studies done in test tubes rather than in animals or humans. If the drug worked, it would be cheap, safe, and available. As the trial got going in April, however, hydroxychloroquine was being touted as a treatment without any rigorous evidence.",
        "\u201cThe world was at a desperate moment and people were jumping to conclusions,\u201d Johnston said.",
        "A year after the treatment trial launched in five cities, Johnston can say hydroxychloroquine had no effect in treating people with COVID-19. The results of the remote randomized, placebo-controlled trial were published Feb. 27 in\u00a0E Clinical Medicine.",
        "The trial was seeking 630 participants, but trial enrollment was stopped in August at 231 participants due to very few people having progressive COVID-19. The primary clinical outcome of the study was progression of COVID-19 to pneumonia or hospitalization, and time to symptom resolution was a secondary outcome.",
        "\u201cThere was no faster resolution of symptoms among people receiving hydroxychloroquine or hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin compared to placebo.\u201d Johnston said.",
        "Another hydroxychloroquine study: There is no compelling data to suggest that hydroxychloroquine is effective",
        "The data are consistent with multiple other randomized trials that have shown that hydroxychloroquine has no benefit in the outpatient or inpatient setting for treatment of COVID-19.",
        "Between April and August, Johnston and colleagues were thrust in the world spotlight. They were interviewed by every major media outlet, including a Turkish talk show. Their message was always that they were conducting a rigorous clinical trial for definitive answers. Smaller trials and observational studies were having mixed results. Some showed it work, others showed it had no effect.",

        "Having analysed data from 54609 matched pairs of patients of all age-groups and demographics, and differing only in strain detected, the team found that there were 227 deaths attributed to the new strain, compared to 141 attributable to earlier strains.",
        "Leon Danon, senior author of the study from the University of Bristol said: \u201cWe focussed our analysis on cases that occurred between November 2020 and January 2021, when both the old variants and the new variant were present in the UK. This meant we were able to maximise the number of \u201cmatches\u201d and reduce the impact of other biases. Subsequent analyses have confirmed our results.",

Published in the journal\u00a0Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology, the laboratory study was funded in part by the Bay Area Lyme Foundation. Collaborating researchers were from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, California Center for Functional Medicine, and FOCUS Health Group, Naturopathic.",
        "\u201cThis research is particularly important as babesiosis is a significant emerging health risk. Due to limited therapeutics and a rise in treatment resistance, current treatment options for this disease are inadequate and many patients rely on herbal therapies for which there is only anecdotal evidence of efficacy,\u201d said co-author Sunjya K.

We hope this data offers inspiration to other researchers to further explore similar options for people living with persistent tick-borne diseases that do not respond to current treatments,\u201d added Dr. Schweig.",
        "While current treatment protocols for babesiosis recommend use of antibiotics including atovaquone, azithromycin, clindamycin, quinine, and their combinations, these regimens are often associated with treatment failures and significant side effects, even in immunocompetent patients.

        "Diphtheria \u2013 a relatively easily-preventable infection \u2013 is evolving to become resistant to a number of classes of antibiotics and in future could lead to vaccine escape, warn an international team of researchers from the UK and India.",
        "The researchers, led by scientists at the University of Cambridge, say that the impact of COVID-19 on diphtheria vaccination schedules, coupled with a rise in the number of infections, risk the disease once more becoming a major global threat.",
        "Diphtheria is a highly contagious infection that can affect the nose and throat, and sometimes the skin. If left untreated it can prove fatal. In the UK and other high-income countries, babies are vaccinated against infection. However, in low- and middle-income countries, the disease can still cause sporadic infections or outbreaks in unvaccinated and partially-vaccinated communities.",
        "The number of diphtheria cases reported globally has being increasing gradually. In 2018, there were 16,651 reported cases, more than double the yearly average for 1996-2017 (8,105 cases).",
        "Diphtheria is primarily caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae and is mainly spread by coughs and sneezes, or through close contact with someone who is infected. In most cases, the bacteria cause acute infections, driven by the diphtheria toxin \u2013 the key target of the vaccine. However, non-toxigenic C. diphtheria can also cause disease, often in the form of systemic infections.",
        "In a study published today in\u00a0Nature Communications, an international team of researchers from the UK and India used genomics to map infections, including a subset from India, where over half of the globally reported cases occurred in 2018.",
        "By analysing the genomes of 61 bacteria isolated from patients and combining these with 441 publicly available genomes, the researchers were able to build a phylogenetic tree \u2013 a genetic \u2018family tree\u2019 \u2013 to see how the infections are related and understand how they spread. They also used this information to assess the presence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and assess toxin variation.",
        "The researchers found clusters to genetically-similar bacteria isolated from multiple continents, most commonly Asia and Europe. This indicates that C. diphtheriae has been established in the human population for at least over a century, spreading across the globe as populations migrated.",
        "\n",
        "The main disease-causing component of C. diphtheriae is the diphtheria toxin, which is encoded by the tox gene. It is this component that is targeted by vaccines. In total, the researchers found 18 different variants of the tox gene, of which several had the potential to change the structure of the toxin.",
        "Professor Gordon Dougan from the Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Disease (CITIID) said: \u201c\u201dThe diphtheria vaccine is designed to neutralise the toxin, so any genetic variants that change the toxin\u2019s structure could have an impact on how effective the vaccine is. While our data doesn\u2019t suggest the currently used vaccine will be ineffective, the fact that we are seeing an ever-increasing diversity of tox variants suggests that the vaccine, and treatments that target the toxin, need to be appraised on a regular basis.\u201d",
        "Diphtheria infections can usually be treated with a number of classes of antibiotic. While C. diphtheriae resistant to antibiotics have been reported, the extent of such resistance remains largely unknown.",
        "When the team looked for genes that might confer some degree of resistance to antimicrobials, they found that the average number of AMR genes per genome was increasing each decade. Genomes of bacteria isolated from infections from the most recent decade (2010-19) showed the highest average number of AMR genes per genome, almost four times as many on average than in the next highest decade, the 1990s.",
        "Robert Will, a PhD student at CITIID and the study\u2019s first author, said: \u201cThe C. diphtheriae genome is complex and incredibly diverse. It\u2019s acquiring resistance to antibiotics that are not even clinically used in the treatment of diphtheria. There must be other factors at play, such as asymptomatic infection and exposure to a plethora of antibiotics meant for treating other diseases.\u201d",

The team identified variants resistant to six of these classes in isolates from the 2010s, higher than in any other decades.",
        "Dr Pankaj Bhatnagar from the World Health Organization country office for India said: \u201cAMR has rarely been considered as a major problem in the treatment of diphtheria, but in some parts of the world, the bacterial genomes are acquiring resistance to numerous classes of antibiotics. There are likely to be a number of reasons to this, including exposure of the bacteria to antibiotics in their environment or in asymptomatic patients being treated against other infections.\u201d",

        "This gap in research knowledge has proved enticing for enterprising young scientist Dr Dee Domingo, who recently joined Flinders University\u2019s fledgling Audiology Department to commence bold new research ideas and analysis of tinnitus \u2013 involving brain stimulation trials to manage the condition and examining whether tinnitus suffers fared worse during COVID-19 lockdowns.",
        "It\u2019s a timely reminder about hearing awareness, on the eve of\u00a0World Hearing Day on March 3, which encourages people to have their hearing tested.",
        "\u201cThis is a hidden disease \u2013 and because it\u2019s not visible, many people simply don\u2019t know it exists, yet it deserves our full attention and focus,\u201d says Dr Domingo, 27, from Whyalla.",
        "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to find the neural networks that underlie tinnitus and use that information to inform new treatments or therapy options. This is the area that hasn\u2019t been plumbed enough.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s the type of disease that is hard to understand if someone hasn\u2019t experienced it, which is why we are going directly to patients for their involvement, to best understand their ongoing problems with tinnitus.\u201d",
        "Dr Domingo is working with Professor Raj Shekhawat, who is currently leading an International Discovery Research Grant funded by the Royal National Institute for the Deaf, United Kingdom. This three-year project \u2013 conducted at Flinders University in collaboration with South Australian Health & Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI) \u2013 is investigating the use of non-invasive brain stimulation for tinnitus management.",
        "As a prelude to these trials \u2013 which are expected to commence in May \u2013 Dr Domingo is preparing a survey to learn how people with tinnitus coped with their condition through COVID-19 lockdowns.",
        "The new survey, being done in conjunction with Professor Bamini Gopinath and collaborators at Macquarie University and expected to be issued in early March, is looking to catalogue the experiences of tinnitus sufferers during COVID-19, when lockdown and isolation would have amplified the effects and annoyance of the condition.",
        "\u201cMany people with tinnitus were living alone with this constant audio annoyance, and without other distractions during lockdown it would have been at the forefront of their thinking at every waking moment,\u201d says Dr Domingo. \u201cWhen you have nothing else to distract you, the noise produced by tinnitus becomes most bothersome, especially when you are attempting to get to sleep. It became their primary focus, and it loomed large as the most upsetting part of their life \u2013 at worst, it has developed into a mental health problem. Our survey needs to understand the true depth of this situation.\u201d",
        "Dr Domingo says the key to her tinnitus survey, for which she expects to have completed within a year, is highlighting the voice of patients in the research \u2013 and making them active participants in the research process. \u201cWe have to have a holistic view to move forward with tinnitus treatment, to stop people from feeling as though they are dealing with this condition in isolation. Information is power.\u201d",
        "Professor Raj Shekhawat says it is necessary for his team\u2019s research to demonstrate the value of tinnitus solutions, and to send a powerful message that will better inform the general public.",
        "\u201cTinnitus is not a disease, but an associated symptom \u2013 and in 99.9% of circumstances it is inflicted damage that triggers tinnitus. It is not just going to happen of its own accord,\u201d says Professor Shekhawat. \u201cIt can be self-inflicted, through exposure to extreme loud music, for example, or industrial noise \u2013 and that once the tiny hairs on the cochlear in the inner ear are damaged, even the slightest bit, they can never be regenerated. It is a sense lost forever \u2013 and that changes people\u2019s perception once they understand that.\u201d",
        "Professor Shekhawat says the importance of conquering the tinnitus problem is more fundamental than most people realise. \u201cWhen a baby is conceived, the first sensory system to develop is hearing. Our abilities with language are all related to our hearing. If your hearing is not functioning, you won\u2019t develop speech and language, then think about the implication on your education, your vocation and social development. Yet it\u2019s only people who suffer hearing problems ever come to truly understand all this.\u201d",
        "Dr Domingo says the explorations of neural networks she is doing with Professor Shekhawat may provide the key to find new answers and solutions for tinnitus treatment.",
        "\u201cTracking the neural networks will finally give us a visual representation of how tinnitus occurs and the damage it inflicts \u2013 and these visuals will help more people understand and appreciate the disease,\u201d she says. \u201cIt will paint a literal picture of what causes it, and that\u2019s the first step on the path to finding solutions.\u201d",

        "Of the nine treatments and preventives for COVID-19 authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration, three are drugs made from so-called monoclonal antibodies. Such drugs provide patients with ready-made antibodies that neutralize the virus, bypassing the body\u2019s slower and sometimes less effective process of making its own antibodies.",
        "But such therapies were developed without detailed information about how antibodies interact with the rest of the immune system during COVID-19. Faced with a new, deadly and fast-spreading disease, drug designers started work without knowing whether antibodies\u2019 ability to activate a variety of immune cells would aid or hinder efforts to control the disease. Such abilities are collectively known as antibody effector functions.",
        "A new study from researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis has shown that antibody effector functions are a crucial part of effectively treating infections with SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 the virus that causes COVID-19 \u2014 but are dispensable when the antibodies are used to prevent infection. The findings, available online in the journal\u00a0Cell, could help scientists improve the next generation of antibody-based COVID-19 drugs.",
        "\u201cSome of the companies removed the effector functions from their antibodies, and other companies are trying to optimize the effector functions,\u201d said senior author Michael S. Diamond, MD, PhD, the Herbert S. Gasser Professor of Medicine. \u201cNeither of these strategies is backed by data in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Based on our findings, if you have a potently neutralizing antibody without effector functions and you give it before infection, as a preventive, it will probably work. But if you give it after infection, it won\u2019t work well; you need to optimize effector functions to get maximal benefit.\u201d",
        "Antibodies are shaped like the letter Y. The tips of the two short arms are almost infinitely changeable, giving antibodies the ability to recognize virtually any molecular shape. The short arms attach to foreign molecules and target them for clearance. The long arm is where the effector functions are located. It attaches to receptors on immune cells, inducing them to kill infected cells and release molecules that sculpt the immune response.",
        "But this process can go wrong. In a process known as antibody-dependent enhancement, interactions between the long arm of antibodies and immune cells can worsen some viral infections, notably infections with the tropical dengue virus. People who have antibodies against one strain of dengue virus are at risk of developing life-threatening dengue fever if they become infected with another strain of the virus.",
        "To avoid the danger of antibody-dependent enhancement, some companies developing antibody-based COVID-19 drugs changed the sequence in the long arm of the antibodies to prevent it from interacting with immune cells. Other companies took the opposite tack: strengthening antibody effector functions to potentially boost the potency of their drugs.",
        "To determine the role of antibody effector functions in COVID-19, Diamond and colleagues, including first author Emma Winkler, an MD/PhD student in Diamond\u2019s lab, and co-senior author James E. Crowe Jr., MD, of Vanderbilt University Medical Center, started with an antibody that is very effective at recognizing and neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. They eliminated the antibody\u2019s effector functions by mutating its long arm so that it could not stimulate immune cells.",

The antibodies were given to the animals one day before they were infected through the nose with the virus that causes COVID-19. Regardless of whether the effector functions of the antibodies were intact, the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies protected the mice against disease. Mice that had received either of the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies lost less weight and had lower levels of virus in their lungs than the ones that received the placebo antibody. Importantly, there was no sign of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease.",
        "Then, the researchers investigated whether antibody effector functions are needed for treatment after infection. They gave mice the virus that causes COVID-19 and treated them one, two or three days later with the original or mutated SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, or a placebo antibody. Compared to the placebo, the original SARS-CoV-2 antibody protected mice against weight loss and death, but the one without effector functions did not.",

        "Some antibody-based drugs for COVID-19 are being developed as preventives for use in high-risk environments such as nursing homes. But most such drugs are geared toward treating people who are already infected. For that purpose, optimizing antibody effector functions could be the key to making a powerful drug, Diamond said. As part of this study, the researchers discovered that the loss of effector functions changed the kinds of immune cells that were recruited to fight the infection and how they behaved.",

Recurrent reactivation in the eye leads to herpes keratitis, which, if left untreated, can result in blindness. HSV infection has also been linked to the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
        "Recurrences of HSV are typically associated with stress, illness or sunburn, but doctors have been uncertain exactly what causes the virus to reactivate. Cliffe and her collaborators found that when neurons harboring the virus were exposed to stimuli that induce \u201cneuronal hyperexcitation,\u201d the virus senses this particular change and seizes its opportunity to reactivate.",
        "Working in a model developed by the Cliffe lab using mouse neurons infected with HSV, the researchers determined that the virus highjacks an important immune response within the body. In response to prolonged periods of inflammation or stress, the immune system releases a particular cytokine, Interleukin 1 beta. This cytokine is also present in epithelial cells in the skin and eye and is released when these cells are damaged by ultraviolet light.",
        "Interleukin 1 beta then increases the excitability in the affected neurons, setting the stage for HSV to flare up, the UVA researchers discovered.",

But the new insights help doctors better understand what is happening in neurons and the immune system, and that could lead to ways to prevent unwanted outbreaks, the researchers hope.",

        "Using inhaled air molecules and particulates, dogs can detect odorous human molecules (volatile organic compounds, or VOCs) that originate from flaked off skin or hair cells, blood, breath, saliva, sweat, tears, nasal mucous, urine, semen, or feces. Since smells linger, dogs can maintain a historical library of the smells of complex molecules.",
        "\u201cThe science behind and efficacy of using dogs in detecting medical conditions and diseases such as cancers, diabetes, malaria, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and more has been documented,\u201d said Heather Junqueira. \u201cThese new studies provide support for additional research to determine their ability to detect COVID-19 at scale.\u201d",
        "",
        "The qualified studies",
        "For their review, the authors assessed four recent studies analyzing the success of scent detecting dogs at identifying VOCs associated with COVID-19. First, they described the work of a team of collaborating researchers from France and Lebanon, who tested with 8 dogs that had previously been trained to detect both explosives and colon cancer.",
        "These dogs were independently presented with cotton or wool gauze samples that had been soaked with sweat from one of 198 human armpits of patients in different hospitals. While the COVID-19 virus does not itself have a smell, researchers hypothesized that the resulting infection generates metabolic changes, which cause the release of a distinctive type of sweat odor that can be detected by a dog.",
        "The dogs were trained to only sit in front of a COVID-19-positive sample contained in a box with a sample canister. After four days of training using COVID-19 samples, the success rate for the dogs ranged between 83 and 100%.",
        "Saliva or tracheobronchial secretions",
        "In another study described by the authors, a research team in Germany conducted a randomized, double-blinded, controlled pilot study to determine whether previously trained scent dogs could successfully detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus. Dogs were trained over 1 week to detect the COVID-19 virus in samples of saliva or tracheobronchial secretions collected from infected patients.",
        "Each dog, its handler, and the person observing the study were blindfolded. The number and duration of each dogs\u2019 \u201cnose dips\u201d into the scent holes, along with the location of the positive and negative samples, were automatically recorded and verified using time-stamped video analysis, which automated the process and reduced trainer interference.",
        "The results, derived from 1,012 automated sample presentations, showed an overall average detection rate of 94%: 157 correct indications of positive, 792 correct rejections of negative, 33 false positives, and 30 false negative indications. Interestingly, the team reported no notable difference in detection ability between the use of sample saliva and sample tracheal secretion.",
        "While that pilot study had limitations\u2013in particular, the positive samples came only from severely affected, hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the negative samples were from healthy individuals with no indications of respiratory infections\u2013the authors of the present study found those results encouraging.",
        "Support for additional research",
        "A third study done by a team in Colombia tested 6 trained scent dogs of various and mixed breeds to develop a screening method for detecting COVID-19 in individuals who may be asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, or symptomatic.",
        "The researchers developed a device to safely expose the scent-trained dogs to VOC samples collected from respiratory secretions of COVID-19-positive patients, and their detailed study was conducted in 3 phases, with the third phase ongoing.",
        "\u201cOf the 6,000 samples, the dogs\u2019 performances [in that study] resulted in a sensitivity of 95.5% and a selectivity of 99.6%,\u201d said Dickey. \u201cThe high success rates among different types of dogs suggests a range of breeds or mixed breeds may be trained to effectively screen for COVID-19.\u201d",
        "Challenges remain",
        "\u201cThe results of recently reported and ongoing research are encouraging; however, there remain challenges to be considered before broad-scale implementation of scent detecting dogs to identify and screen for COVID-19,\u201d said Junqueira. \u201cNonetheless, the research supports the use of scent detection dogs for pilot COVID-19 screening studies in venues such as airports and sporting events.\u201d",
        "The authors hope that their research review, which presented recent information and perspectives on the potential for broad application of trained scent dogs for screening of COVID-19-infected individuals, can be used to assist in the development of future studies and implementation of screening programs to benefit preventative medical research."

    "Article": [
        "A new study published in\u00a0CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) found that the risk of death from COVID-19 was\u00a03.5 times higher than from influenza.",
        "\u201cWe can now say definitively that COVID-19 is much more severe than seasonal influenza,\u201d says Dr. Amol Verma, St. Michael\u2019s Hospital, Unity Health Toronto, and the University of Toronto. \u201cPatients admitted to hospital in Ontario with COVID-19 had a 3.5 times greater risk of death, 1.5 times greater use of the ICU, and 1.5 times longer hospital stays than patients admitted with influenza.\u201d",
        "These findings are similar to study results recently reported in France and the United States.",
        "The study compared hospitalizations for influenza between November 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020, in 7 large hospitals in Toronto and Mississauga \u2014 areas with large populations and high levels of COVID-19. It included all patients admitted to medical services or the intensive care unit (ICU) for influenza or COVID-19. There were 783 hospitalizations for influenza in 763 unique patients compared with 1027 hospitalizations for COVID-19 in 972 unique patients (representing 23.5% of all hospitalizations for COVID-19 in Ontario during the study period).",
        "Most patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had few other illnesses, and 21% were younger than 50 years of age. People younger than 50 also accounted for almost 1 in 4 (24%) admissions to the ICU.",
        "\u201cMany people believe that COVID-19 mainly affects older people,\u201d says Dr. Verma. \u201cIt is true that COVID-19 affects older adults most severely. We found that among adults over 75 years who were hospitalized with COVID-19, nearly 40% died in hospital. But it can also cause very serious illness in younger adults. Adults under 50 accounted for 20% of all COVID-19 hospitalizations in the first wave of the pandemic. Nearly 1 in 3 adults younger than 50 hospitalized with COVID-19 required intensive care, and nearly 1 in 10 required an unplanned readmission to hospital after discharge.\u201d",
        "People hospitalized for COVID-19 had greater use of the ICU, were more likely to be put on a ventilator and had longer hospital stays than people with influenza.",
        "\u201cThese differences may be magnified by low levels of immunity to the novel coronavirus compared with seasonal influenza, which results from past infections and vaccination,\u201d says Dr. Verma. \u201cHopefully, the severity of COVID-19 will decrease over time as people are vaccinated against the virus and more effective treatments are identified. There is, unfortunately, also the possibility that variants of the virus could be even more severe.\u201d",

Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that rabies causes 59,000 human deaths annually in over 150 countries, with 95% of cases occurring in Africa and Asia \u2013 however they concede it is likely a gross underestimate of the true burden of disease.",

        "Once clinical symptoms appear; rabies is virtually 100% fatal.",
        "The current treatment for previously unvaccinated people potentially exposed to rabies is called rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which includes thorough wound washing, passive neutralization of the virus with infiltration of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) into and around the wound site, and a series of 4 doses of rabies vaccine given over a 2-week timeframe.",
