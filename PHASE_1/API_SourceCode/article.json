This does not necessarily mean that the events are linked to vaccination itself, but it is good practice to investigate them. It also shows that the surveillance system works and that effective controls are in place.WHO is in regular contact with the European Medicines Agency and regulators around the world for the latest information on COVID-19 vaccine safety.At this time, WHO considers that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh its risks and recommends that vaccinations continue.Sweden pauses use of AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine pending investigationSpain suspends AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine for the next two weeksNorway reports blood clots in young people with the AstraZeneca vaccinePhilippines say no reason to stop rollout of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine",

This has been decided as a precautionary measure, while they conduct a full investigation to determine causality between the vaccination and the reported adverse events following immunization.Moreover, the European Medicine Authority (EMA) has also emphasized that there is currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions, which are not listed as side effects with this vaccine, saying, \u201cThe position of EMA\u2019s safety committee PRAC is that the vaccine\u2019s benefits continue to outweigh its risks and the vaccine can continue to be administered while investigation of cases of thromboembolic events is ongoing. PRAC is already reviewing all cases of thromboembolic events, and other conditions related to blood clots, reported post-vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca.\u201dAt present, the DOH and FDA emphasize that there is no indication for the Philippines to stop rollout of AstraZeneca vaccines. The DOH, NTF and FDA are closely coordinating on this matter. The public is assured they will closely monitor all deployed vaccines.\n",

The Chapter supports SB 1936 filed by Senator Lauren Book which would remove non-medical exemptions for vaccines statewide and help ensure that Florida\u2019s children are protected from serious vaccine preventable diseases through the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.\u00a0\u201cVaccines are the most effective and safest way of preventing communicable diseases and save between two and three million\u00a0 children\u2019s lives each year,\u201d says Dr. Lisa Gwynn, President of the Florida Chapter of American Academy of Pediatrics. \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has shown us firsthand that we cannot let our guard down and must continue to make vaccinations a number one public\u00a0 health priority.\u201d\u00a0During the COVID-19 pandemic, the State of Florida has seen a dramatic decline in childhood immunizations, leaving Florida\u2019s\u00a0 children and most vulnerable populations at risk for vaccine preventable diseases. The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0 (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend children continue to receive routine vaccinations during the\u00a0 COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0Senator Book\u2019s bill would not affect necessary medical exemptions for children who are unable to be vaccinated due to allergies or\u00a0 reactions to specific vaccines or those whose immune systems are compromised by medication or illness. In these cases, a physician\u00a0 would still be able to grant a medical exemption.5 Vaccine preventable diseases in the US: Then and nowParents should remember that proper steps have been taken to keep them and their family safe during their visit to their child\u2019s pediatrician.

The VLA15-221 study builds on previous positive Phase 2 studies, incorporates new dose regimens and is anticipated to be the final Phase 2 study readout before a decision to progress into pivotal Phase 3 studies.VLA15-221 is a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study. It will be the first VLA15 study to include a pediatric population (aged 5-17 years). Overall, the study will enroll approximately 600 healthy participants (aged 5-65 years) who will receive VLA15 or placebo. It will compare the three-dose vaccination schedule (Month 0-2-6) with a two-dose schedule (Month 0-6).We are excited to be part of the Lyme disease vaccine development program with Valneva. We hope this Phase 2 trial, with a simplified schedule, will provide evidence that the investigational vaccine can be used in populations that are at risk of contracting Lyme disease, potentially including children age five years and older,\u201d\u00a0said Kathrin Jansen, Senior Vice President and Head of Pfizer Vaccine Research and Development.Juan Carlos Jaramillo, Chief Medical Officer of Valneva commented, \u201cThis trial initiation marks an important step\u00a0in the development of VLA15 toward a potential licensure. Including a pediatric population in Phase 2 means we could, if successful, add this population to the Phase 3 research program, to potentially offer a\u00a0vaccine for Lyme disease that may help prevent disease in both adults and children, if approved.

    ],
    "Article": "Rokote Laboratories Finland Ltd., a newly-founded academic spin-out based in Finland is working to develop and introduce to the markets a nasal spray vaccine against COVID. The vaccine is based on research carried out at the University of Helsinki and the University of Eastern Finland.The vaccine uses gene transfer technology developed at the University of Eastern Finland by Academy Professor Seppo Yl\u00e4-Herttuala\u2019s research group, and the technology has already been successfully used in several clinical trials using gene therapy to treat cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The vaccine uses a safe adenovirus carrier that contains a cloned DNA strand, which causes nasopharyngeal cells to produce the virus protein which, in turn, produces a response to the vaccine. There is no actual SARS-CoV-2 virus in the vaccine. Preliminary results show that the vaccine has performed well in animal studies, and clinical testing in humans will start within a few months.Nasal delivery was chosen as the new vaccine\u2019s method of administration because the virus is also naturally transmitted through the airways. Indeed, nasal administration seems to induce a wider immune response than intramuscular administration.\u201cVaccines injected intramuscularly produce IgG antibodies in the bloodstream, but nasal vaccines also produce an IgA response that protects mucous membranes. We assume that this can also prevent those who have received the vaccine from transmitting the virus,\u201d Academy Professor Seppo Yl\u00e4-Herttuala from the University of Eastern Finland says.According to him, the currently ongoing vaccination programmes do not eliminate the need for new vaccines, as new variants are expected to cause new waves of infection.\u201cEven if we were able to vaccinate the entire population, at least people in medical risk groups will still need new vaccines against new variants in the upcoming years. The vaccines currently in use provide a clearly lower protection against the South African variant, which will likely be the dominant virus in the next wave. Our vaccine already takes into account the most important variants, i.e. the South African, Brazilian and the UK one. There will certainly be a demand for this type of vaccine,\u201d says Professor of Virology Kalle Saksela from the University of Helsinki.The company will carry out the first clinical vaccine trials in Finland. In Kuopio, there is already the commercial technology needed to produce the vaccine.The founders and board members of Rokote Laboratories Finland Ltd. are the vaccine developers Academy Professor Seppo Yl\u00e4-Herttuala from the University of Eastern Finland, Professor Kalle Saksela and Professor Kari Alitalo from the University of Helsinki, and Mr Pasi Kemppainen, MSc (Techn.). The University of Helsinki and the University of Eastern Finland are also co-founders of, and shareholders in, the company.According to Mr Kemppainen, the company is now negotiating on funding to ensure further development of the vaccine and its moving towards clinical trials. After being granted a marketing authorisation, the vaccine could ensure Finnish and European security of supply, and vaccine self-sufficiency.\u201cThe vaccine can be manufactured in considerable quantities here in Kuopio and, in the long term, it can also be licensed outside Europe. The current focus is, of course, on the COVID vaccine, but the same method can also be used to develop vaccines against other viruses,\u201d Mr Kemppainen says.",

FLUCELVAX QUADRIVALENT will be available as a 0.5ml intramuscular (IM) vaccine per dose for the 2021/22 U.S. influenza season.The expanded age indication is based on absolute efficacy data indicating that FLUCELVAX QUADRIVALENT was effective and produced a sufficient immune response against influenza in children and adolescents between \u22652 to <18 years of age over three influenza seasons in the Southern (2017) and Northern (2017/18 and 2018/19) Hemispheres, compared to a non-influenza comparator.\u00a0This represents the first absolute efficacy study of a cell-based influenza vaccine in this population.\u201cYoung children are at a high risk of complications from influenza, which is why annual vaccination is critical,\u201d said\u00a0Gregg Sylvester, MD, Chief Medical Officer at Seqirus. \u201cThe absolute efficacy results for FLUCELVAX QUADRIVALENT that served as the basis for this approval indicate that the cell-based vaccine offers an important new option for children as young as two years of age.\u201dOutbreak News Interviews podcast on SpotifyFLUCELVAX QUADRIVALENT utilizes a cell-based influenza vaccine manufacturing process, an alternative to traditional egg-based manufacturing. There are several factors that can impact seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness, which may include mismatch between circulating strains and the influenza strains contained within the seasonal influenza vaccine. Egg-based manufacturing requires a growth-inducing strain to ensure the influenza virus can grow successfully in eggs, which can cause the strain to mutate and result in an influenza virus that can be different from the intended strain.\u00a0This may lead to a mismatch between the circulating strains and the inactivated influenza strains contained within the seasonal influenza vaccine. Cell-based influenza vaccines like FLUCELVAX QUADRIVALENT are designed to help avoid egg-adapted changes and may result in vaccine virus strains that are more closely matched to those selected by the World Health Organization.\u00a0Cell-based influenza vaccine technology may offer additional advantages over the standard influenza manufacturing process, including being more scalable and offering faster production in the event of an influenza pandemic.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the best way to prevent influenza is by receiving an annual seasonal influenza vaccine.\u00a0More than 52,000 hospitalizations occurred in children aged 18 years of age and younger during the 2019/20 U.S. influenza season, and there were over 434 influenza-related deaths in this age group.\u00a0Children younger than five years of age are at high risk of developing serious flu-related complications.\u00a0The CDC recommends everyone six months of age and older without contraindications receive an influenza vaccine annually.\u00a0",

    ],
    "Article": "On Saturday,\u00a0the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the third vaccine for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The EUA allows the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine to be distributed in the U.S for use in individuals 18 years of age and older.\u201cThe authorization of this vaccine expands the availability of vaccines, the best medical prevention method for COVID-19, to help us in the fight against this pandemic, which has claimed over half a million lives in the United States,\u201d said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. \u201cThe FDA, through our open and transparent scientific review process, has now authorized three COVID-19 vaccines with the urgency called for during this pandemic, using the agency\u2019s rigorous standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization.\u201dThe FDA has determined that the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine has met the statutory criteria for issuance of an EUA. The totality of the available data provides clear evidence that the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine may be effective in preventing COVID-19. The data also show that the vaccine\u2019s known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks, supporting the company\u2019s request for the vaccine\u2019s use in people 18 years of age and older. In making this determination, the FDA can assure the public and medical community that it has conducted a thorough evaluation of the available safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality information.The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is manufactured using a specific type of virus called adenovirus type 26 (Ad26). The vaccine uses Ad26 to deliver a piece of the DNA, or genetic material, that is used to make the distinctive \u201cspike\u201d protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. While adenoviruses are a group of viruses that are relatively common, Ad26, which can cause cold symptoms and pink eye, has been modified for the vaccine so that it cannot replicate in the human body to cause illness. After a person receives this vaccine, the body can temporarily make the spike protein, which does not cause disease, but triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against SARS-CoV-2.\u201cAfter a thorough analysis of the data, the FDA\u2019s scientists and physicians have determined that the vaccine meets the FDA\u2019s expectations for safety and effectiveness appropriate for the authorization of a vaccine for emergency use,\u201d said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. \u201cWith today\u2019s authorization, we are adding another vaccine in our medical toolbox to fight this virus. At the same time, the American people can be assured of the FDA\u2019s unwavering commitment to public health through our comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of the data submitted for vaccines to prevent COVID-19.\u201dThe Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is administered as a single dose. The available safety data to support the EUA include an analysis of 43,783 participants enrolled in an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled study being conducted in South Africa, certain countries in South America, Mexico, and the U.S. The participants, 21,895 of whom received the vaccine and 21,888 of whom received saline placebo, were followed for a median of eight weeks after vaccination. The most commonly reported side effects were pain at the injection site, headache, fatigue, muscle aches and nausea. Most of these side effects were mild to moderate in severity and lasted 1-2 days.As part of the authorization, the FDA notes that it is mandatory for Janssen Biotech Inc. and vaccination providers to report the following to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine: serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death.It is also mandatory for vaccination providers to report all vaccine administration errors to VAERS for which they become aware and for Janssen Biotech Inc. to include a summary and analysis of all identified vaccine administration errors in monthly safety reports submitted to the FDA.The effectiveness data to support the EUA include an analysis of 39,321 participants in the ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled study being conducted in South Africa, certain countries in South America, Mexico, and the U.S. who did not have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to receiving the vaccine. Among these participants, 19,630 received the vaccine and 19,691 received saline placebo. Overall, the vaccine was approximately 67% effective in preventing moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 occurring at least 14 days after vaccination and 66% effective in preventing moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 occurring at least 28 days after vaccination.Additionally, the vaccine was approximately 77% effective in preventing severe/critical COVID-19 occurring at least 14 days after vaccination and 85% effective in preventing severe/critical COVID-19 occurring at least 28 days after vaccination.There were 116 cases of COVID-19 in the vaccine group that occurred at least 14 days after vaccination, and 348 cases of COVID-19 in the placebo group during this time period. There were 66 cases of COVID-19 in the vaccine group that occurred at least 28 days after vaccination and 193 cases of COVID-19 in the placebo group during this time period. Starting 14 days after vaccination, there were 14 severe/critical cases in the vaccinated group versus 60 in the placebo group, and starting 28 days after vaccination, there were 5 severe/critical in the vaccine group versus 34 cases in the placebo group.At this time, data are not available to determine how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person.",
